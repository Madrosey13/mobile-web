            <h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
            <p>It has been said that you should do what you love and you will not consider it a job.  Charlotte Williams, the owner of Pinwheel Fabrics is living her passion and loving every minute of it.  She has been sewing most of her life.  Starting out very young and and trying her hand at everything.  In the early 70's she settled on quilting.  She started traditionally piecing by hand and over the years evolved to using the sewing machine for the complete process. It has been a fun journey learning new techniques and hopefully the journey has just begun.</p>
            <p>Pinwheel Fabrics is sewn into their community. A certified Janome and Handi Quilter dealer and repair shop. We have been supporting local quilt guilds and proudly serving Central Arkansasâ€™s quilters since 2004.</p>
